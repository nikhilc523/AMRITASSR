## Branch 3.x ##

### 3.11.2 ###

* Bugfix: disabled `gracefulExit` by default, because the default SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers of nodejs are removed

### 3.11.1 ###

* Bugfix: `MaxListenersExceededWarning` was triggered by `gracefulExit` handlers added in `v3.11.0` - thanks to [TychoTheTaco on GitHub](https://github.com/npkgz/cli-progress/pull/125)

### 3.11.0 ###

* Added: `log()` convenience method the multibar to enable custom logging output on top of the progress bars during operation
* Added: `gracefulExit` option (enabled by default) to stop the bars in case of `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` - this restores most cursor settings before exiting
* Added: `progressCalculationRelative` option (disabled by default) to use the `startValue` as offset for the progress calculation and calculate the absolute progress from the difference given by `total-startValue` #121
* Added: ability to pass bar options (overrides the global options) to `multibar.create`
* Bugfix: within a non-tty environment (e.g. CI/CD taskrunners) `multibar.create()` returns an undefined value in case `noTTYOutput` is not enabled #117

### 3.10.0 ###

* Changed: foreground color of `preset.shades-grey` is set directly by ANSI codes
* Changed: example snippet
